The key plays a crucial role in signing and verifying the token, ensuring it hasn't been tampered with. The process involves creating a token with three parts: the payload, the secret key, and the expiry time. The secret key is essential for the server to verify the authenticity of the token sent by the client.

      "A JWT (JSON Web Token) works by taking a string and converting it into a token that can be used for authentication. The key plays a crucial role in signing and verifying the token, ensuring that it hasn't been tampered with. It does not encrypt or decrypt the token but is used to sign the token on the server side. The JWT consists of three parts: the payload, the secret key, and the expiry time. The secret key is essential for the server to verify the authenticity of the token sent by the client. If the token is valid, the server allows the client to proceed with further activities.\n",
