The key plays a crucial role in signing and verifying the token, ensuring that it hasn\\'t been tampered with. The JWT consists of three parts: the payload, the secret key, and the expiry time. The payload contains the claims, the secret key is used by the server to verify the authenticity of the token, and the expiry time defines how long the token is valid. The server uses the secret key to compare and verify the token sent by the client, allowing the client to perform further activities only if the token is valid.\"}',\n",

This approach allows the UI to reflect changes immediately and also updates the backend accordingly.\"}',\n",

If the styles are showing but not applied, it might indicate a configuration issue with Tailwind. Additionally, refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation to verify that it is set up correctly in your project.

Can anyone explain why this happened?\",\"answer\":\"The issue you faced might be related to how the \\'return\\' statement was used in your code, potentially affecting the flow of execution in your server routes. When dealing with middleware like CORS, it\\'s important to ensure that the middleware functions are properly executed and not prematurely terminated by a \\'return\\' statement. By removing the \\'return\\', you allowed the middleware to complete its execution, which resolved the issue. Additionally, ensuring that CORS is properly configured with the correct origin and methods, as suggested by the teaching assistants, is crucial for it to function correctly.\"}']"

      "The `useState` hook is a fundamental part of React that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state. Here's a basic example to illustrate how `useState` works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Counter Example**:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   import React, { useState } from 'react';\n",
      "\n",
      "   const Counter = () => {\n",
      "     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
      "\n",
      "     return (\n",
      "       <div>\n",
      "         <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n",
      "         <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n",
      "           Click me\n",
      "         </button>\n",
      "       </div>\n",
      "     );\n",
      "   };\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   In this example, `useState(0)` initializes the state variable `count` to 0. The `setCount` function is used to update the state whenever the button is clicked, incrementing the count by 1 (reference page: 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Posts Example**:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   import { useState } from \"react\";\n",
      "   import { PostComponent } from \"./Post\";\n",

      "       <PostComponent\n",
      "         name={post.name}\n",
      "         subtitle={post.subtitle}\n",

      "         description={post.description}\n",

      "     return (\n",
      "       <div>\n",

      "       </div>\n",
      "     );\n",
      "   }\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   Here, `useState([])` initializes the `posts` state as an empty array. The `setPosts` function can be used to update this array, for example, by adding new posts (reference page: 4).\n",
